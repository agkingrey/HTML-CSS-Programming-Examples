			<strong>City Gardens & Landscaping</strong> has tackled just about every kind of landscaping project you can imagine. If it involves the outdoors, we can design it. We also have the added benefit of carrying our own top quality plants and landscape supplies.
			Our full service Nursery and Garden Center allows YOU to select what goes into your project. We're always happy to get your input before we begin.
		</p>
		<h3>We'll Help</h3>

			If you want to tackle your project yourself, let us help. We'll be glad to take you step by step though the process, and deliver all of your materials when and where you need them. 
			<em>We pride ourselves in giving accurate estimates</em>, with no "surprises". Just give us a call to start the process.
