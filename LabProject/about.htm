		<h2>Our History</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>City Gardens & Landscaping</strong> started business in 2005 by founder Mr. Joe Boxelder. We started from humble beginnings, running two landscaping crews,
			and operating a small retail nursery. As the City of DesMoines grew, so did we.
		</p>
		<h2>Our Staff</h2>
		<p>
			Over the years, <strong>City Gardens & Landscaping</strong> has tripled both in size, and in products offered. We;ve been under the same name and <strong class="blackText">ownership for over 10 years.</strong> City Gardens & Landscaping now employees 30-40 employees, and carries the largest selection of plant materials in the area.
			We have strong ties to the local community, and have decades of landscape history and community service work here.
