<p>Venice is a beautiful city that is on the river. This city has amazing food, great scenery, and a friendly atmosphere.
	The biggest draw to the city is the water, but little know about its rich history in art.  Some of the world's most famous
	 paintings come from this city.</p>

<section id="middle">
<p>Hawaii will blow your mind.  Beautiful beaches, great food, and a relaxed atmosphere await you.  Enjoy the calm waves crashing
	 on the shore or visit one of our many tourist attractions.  This is the place to get reconnected with nature.  Hawaii is my own
	 personal favorite.</p>
</section>
<section id="bottom">
<p>New York is great for the person who likes to do a lot. Shows, restaurants, and many other exciting events happen every day.  If you
	 stopped at one restaurant in new york every night, it would still take multiple lifetimes to see them all.</p>
