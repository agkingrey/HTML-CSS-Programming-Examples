	of MSU's campus town, Zanzibars is designed to be a funky destination. We serve premium products such
	as fresh roasted coffee and espresso drinks, hot and cold teas, grilled and cold sandwiches, and homemade
	soups. Not just a daytime destination! Stop by in the evening, enjoy a glass of wine or beer and listen to

	<h1>About the owners:</h1>
	
	<h2>Michel Bohmer</h2>
	<p>Michel grew up in the little town of Justice, Illinois. He was a farm boy who decided that he didn't want
	to spend his entire life in the small town, so he moved to Minneapolis to educate himself and to start a business.
	Little did he know, that he would soon find out his passion for coffee during long study sessions.  This sparked
	his passion to start Roastie's.</p>
	
	<h2>Sandy Thomas</h2>
	<p>Born and raised in Minneapolis, Sandy was always a go getter.  She finished top in her class with honors out of
	high school, and continued that through college. She met Michel on her 3rd year at MSU, where they quickly became
	friends.  Sandy was willing to help Michael learn about how big city life works, and how to start a business here.</p>
