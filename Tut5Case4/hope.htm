<h3 class="clear">Your part in this new adventure</h3>

<p>Every citizen in a New Hope will have a voice in the governing of the planet. Every single decision will come down to a majority vote, and the will of 
	the people will be heard. There are a few ground rules that need to be set beforehand though. 1. Every citizen must work until they are 60. 2. Every 
	citizen must vote in every decision. 3. Every citizen must wear a purple hat at all time.</p>

<h3>How A New Hope was discovered</h3>

<p>New Hope was discovered by the great astronaut, William PurpleHat.  As Mr. PurpleHat was cruizing the stars, he saw a blue blip in the distance.  All
	of his sensors pointed towards life on the planet, so he went to investigate.  He found beautiful plains, odd insects, and many animals, both friendly 
	and hostile.</p>
